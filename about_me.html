<p>Hello,My name is Pete Mathew and i am a motivated learner currently building my foundation in web development.
  I am learning HTML and gradually expanding my skills toward becoming a full-stack developer. 
  I enjoy creating structured and user-friendly web pages and continuously improving 
  my technical abilities.</p><p>I also have a strong interest in logistics and supply chain management. 
  I am curious about how technology and operations work together to improve efficiency, 
  coordination, and decision-making in real-world systems.I believe in consistent growth, disciplined learning, and practical skill development. 
  Outside of academics and technology, I enjoy reading fiction, exploring space-related topics, 
  and following football.</p><p>My goal is to build a career where I can combine analytical thinking, technical knowledge, 
  and problem-solving skills to create meaningful impact.</p>
